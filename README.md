## About Me

I am a 5th year PhD student in the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics at Emory University. My dissertation advisor is Dr. Hao Wu. We are currently working on novel statistical approaches to detect a mediation effect while accounting for a latent variable (e.g. cell type), with primary application to DNA methylation and gene expression data. I also enjoy my collaborative projects and teaching experiences. After I complete my PhD, I plan to pursue an academic position.

I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with bachelors degrees in biostatistics and mathematics and a minor in music. I worked with Dr. Nick Battista in Dr. Laura Miller's computational biology lab studying fluid dynamics in embryonic heart development. Through this work, I was introduced to the process of research and learned to code in Matlab.

In my free time, I enjoy playing instruments (primarily piano and ukulele), watching UNC basketball, and reading. I also volunteer for multiple disability advocacy organizations and am a local ambassador for the Georgia Muscular Dystrophy Association.
