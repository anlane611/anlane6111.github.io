## About Me

I am a 4th year PhD student in the department of biostatistics and bioinformatics at Emory University. My dissertation advisor is Dr. Hao Wu. We are currently working on novel statistical approaches to detect a mediation effect while accounting for different cell types in a sample. This can be applied to DNA methylation or gene expression data.

Prior to starting my PhD, I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with bachelors degrees in biostatistics and mathematics and a minor in music.
